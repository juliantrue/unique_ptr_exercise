# unique_ptr Exercise Overview
This repo contains my implementation of the `unique_ptr` class. 

The purpose of this exercise is:
1. Understand what scoping things properly actually looks like.
2. Pros and cons of operator overload.
3. What writing generic objects with templates would look like.
4. A good first approximation to achieve a similar affect as a GC.
5. Stack vs heap memory.
6. Introduction to deep vs shallow copy.

Additionally, this is a great excuse to play around with:
1. Bazel build system.
2. New C++ 20 stuff like modules.
